The parameterisation of our seasonal food web model for the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest relies on the two following publications:

SEtAl2016: [Seasonal species interactions minimize the impact of species turnover on the likelihood of community persistence.](https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1013.1) (2016) Saavedra S., Rohr R.P., Fortuna M.A., Selva N., Bascompte J. Ecology, 97: 865-873

J&J1998: [Predation in Vertebrate Communities. The Bia&#322;owie&#380;a Primeval Forest as a Case Study](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540641384) (1998) J&#281;drzejewska B., J&#281;drzejewski W. Springer Verlag, Berlin.

When using this parameterisation, please cite the two above-mentionned works, along with the manuscript associated to the parameterisation:

From winter to summer and back: lessons from the parameterisation of a seasonal food web model for the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest. (2020) Sauve A.M.C., Barraquand F.

We share here the data collected from these two sources used in the parameterisation of the food web model:

* Files in `SaavedraEtAl_2016_Supplements` are two bipartite matrices describing the food web of the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest for both summer (`Supplement_A_summer_data.csv`) and winter (`Supplement_B_winter_data.csv`).

* Files in `BPF_Data` are tables extracted from J&J1998's monograph on the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest. These tables specifically detail predators diet across seasons. Each file is named after the table name in the monograph.
