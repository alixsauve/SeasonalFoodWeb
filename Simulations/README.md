This folder share MATLAB scripts associate to the simulations of the seasonal food web model of the the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest run for our manuscript.

Scripts listed in `Mains` call functions stored in `Functions` and save the simulated time series in `Outputs`. They also requires parameter values and species densities stored in `../Parameterisation/OutputTables`.
